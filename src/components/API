API-Application programming interface
there is a interface between two programming language where data can be shared to connect to the database and display on frontend.
Js (Vue, React, Angular and so on) they cannot connect to the database directly. So need API to connect to the database.

npm i axios

create-data create
get-data get
post-data post
put- data update
